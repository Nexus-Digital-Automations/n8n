Code quality standards could be strengthened\n5. Pre-commit hooks and quality gates need optimization\n\nActions needed:\n- Optimize lint performance across all packages\n- Enhance ESLint rules for better code quality\n- Implement stricter TypeScript checking\n- Add automated code quality metrics\n- Strengthen pre-commit quality checks\n- Review and update coding standards documentation",
