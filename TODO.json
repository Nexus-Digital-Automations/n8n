Editor UI build is very slow and memory intensive\n2. Build process requires high memory allocation (--max-old-space-size=8192)\n3. Vite build warnings about browser compatibility\n4. Multiple packages building sequentially instead of optimized parallel execution\n\nActions needed:\n- Optimize build configuration for faster execution\n- Address memory usage issues\n- Fix vite browser compatibility warnings\n- Implement build caching strategies\n- Consider build parallelization improvements",

Code quality standards could be strengthened\n5. Pre-commit hooks and quality gates need optimization\n\nActions needed:\n- Optimize lint performance across all packages\n- Enhance ESLint rules for better code quality\n- Implement stricter TypeScript checking\n- Add automated code quality metrics\n- Strengthen pre-commit quality checks\n- Review and update coding standards documentation",
